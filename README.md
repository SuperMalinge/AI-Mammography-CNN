# Mammography Analysis CNN

A powerful deep learning model for automated mammography analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks. This model excels at breast cancer detection, tumor segmentation, and tissue density analysis.

## Features

- Breast mass detection and segmentation
- Microcalcification identification
- High-resolution image processing (2048x2048)
- Specialized contrast enhancement
- Real-time visualization of detection results
- Advanced preprocessing for mammograms
- Support for DICOM and other medical imaging formats

## Clinical Applications

- Early breast cancer detection
- Tumor segmentation
- Microcalcification analysis
- Tissue density classification
- Screening support
- Clinical decision assistance

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- pydicom (for DICOM processing)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mammography-analysis.git
cd mammography-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
